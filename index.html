        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I'm a college student who is originally from Côte d'ivoire. My true passion it's art 
        and it's the reason i'm exited to wake up each morning. I especially do love cinema, 
        anime, video games, travel and music. I found inspiration in these art forms and it really shape
    the way I see the world; I really like to travel a lot in countries I've never have been before. 
 </p>
 <p> Generally I'm more reserved than shy. I tend to enjoy spending time alone while many of my friends
    are more extroverted. After living in france for a year in the beautiful city of Montpellier, I moved
to Canada. This transition was a bit of shock because I moved from the warm climate of southern France to 
Canada cold weather. I immersed myself in the culture while studying graphic design, witch increased my passion 
for creativity.
